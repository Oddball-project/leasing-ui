            At Website Name, accessible at Website.com, one of our main
            priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy
            document contains types of information that is collected and
            recorded by Website Name and how we use it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-2">
            Your privacy statement should be clear, direct, and easy to
            understand.

                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
                but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
                injected humour, or randomized words which don't look even
                slightly believable.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="mb-2">
                If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
                sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of
                text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to
                repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first
                true generator on the Internet.
              </p>

                On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
                dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
                pleasure of the moment.

                It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
                handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum
                which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore
                always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                non-characteristic words etc.

            ourselves without judgement, allows us to think freely without
            discrimination, and is an important element of giving us control
            over who knows what about us.
