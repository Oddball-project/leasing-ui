    &lt;BAccordionItem title=&quot;What are webhooks?&quot; visible&gt;
        Webhooks allow you to gather real time data on key
        interactions that happen with your Slick Text account. Simply
        provide us with a url where you'd like the data to be sent,
        choose which events you'd like to be informed of, and click
        save.
    &lt;/BAccordionItem&gt;
    &lt;BAccordionItem title=&quot;Where can I find my Textword ID?&quot;&gt;
        Head over to the Textwords page. Click options on the right
        hand side, and then click Settings. This will redirect you to
        your Textword Setting page. Now, go check your url, and the
        textword ID will be the number after &quot;word=&quot;. Too much or too
        little spacing, as in the example below.
    &lt;/BAccordionItem&gt;
    &lt;BAccordionItem title=&quot;Where is your API documentation?&quot;&gt;
        You always want to make sure that your fonts work well
        together and try to limit the number of fonts you use to three
        or less. Experiment and play around with the fonts that you
        already have in the software you&rsquo;re working with reputable
        font websites.
